  message: 'Detected a cookie options with the `SameSite` flag set to "None". This
    is a potential security risk that arises from the way web browsers manage cookies.
    In a typical web application, cookies are used to store and transmit session-related
    data between a client and a server. To enhance security, cookies can be marked
    with the "SameSite" attribute, which restricts their usage based on the origin
    of the page that set them. This attribute can have three values: "Strict," "Lax,"
    or "None". Make sure the `SameSite` attribute of the important cookies (e.g.,
    session cookie) is set to a reasonable value. When `SameSite` is set to "Strict",
    no 3rd party cookie will be sent with outgoing requests, this is the most secure
    and private setting but harder to deploy with good usability. Setting it to "Lax"
    is the minimum requirement.'
