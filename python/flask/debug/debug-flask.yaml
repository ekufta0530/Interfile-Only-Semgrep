  message: The application is running debug code or has debug mode enabled. This may
    expose sensitive information, like stack traces and environment variables, to
    attackers. It may also modify application behavior, potentially enabling attackers
    to bypass restrictions. To remediate this finding, ensure that the application's
    debug code and debug mode are disabled or removed from the production environment.
